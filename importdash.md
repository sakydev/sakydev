### What
Dashboard for managing and visualizing vehicle accident & salvage data from 30+ states in the USA

### Why 
The company worked with different states to acquire vehicle data. Then built several tools utilizing data to sell vehicle histories and more to customers. All states had different data formats, file storage, and access requirements. The hardcoded scripts failed often without clear reasons. A visual dashboard was the solution.

### How
I implemented a dashboard powered by Python & Flask. Admin could add new sources, how they're accessed, frequency, file formats and other configuration options. The background scripts then processed source accordingly. Dashboard also clearly reflected latest state of imports, records and overall statistics.
