### What
Headless content management system built as Laravel package for seamless integration. It allows you to define collections, fields, field restrictions, validations, translations and more. CMS is currently in development but I've open-sourced already because I like the thought of someone watching what I'm building.

### Why
There are a couple good headless solutions in the market but I saw a gap for Laravel. Also, I sensed most companies/users don't want to throw away everything and adopt something new. Hence, a hybrid answer. This package sits inside your Laravel application with modifying existing functionality. The endpoints are exposed along with dashboard and then you decide how to proceed.
