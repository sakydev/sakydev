### What
ClipBucket is an Open Source and freely downloadable PHP script that will let you start your own video-sharing website (YouTube Clone) in a matter of minutes. ClipBucket comes with the most advanced video-sharing and social features.

### How
ClipBucket was my first project. I had little knowledge of programming and web development. All I had was an unyielding passion and undying will. I poured sweat & tears into this project. I was contributing to community forums, actively fixing issues, talking to clients, building plugins and helping polish releases. I went from being an internee to leading a project in less than 2 years. 

I learned video manipulation with FFMPEG, Mp4Box and other tools. I understood how servers communicate with each other. I grasped how to decouple things by diving into plugins and also understood the community and business side of things.
